    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>
      I am an Experimental Perceptual-Motor Scientist with nearly a decade of experience using VR and AR to study human perception and locomotion. 
      I received my PhD in Cogntive Science from Brown University in the Winter of 2021. My doctoral thesis implemented virtual reality in a 10x10m room to examine how humans walked through pre-generated crowd stimuli. 
      Since Fall of 2020, I have been a post-doctoral researcher in the Human Movement Neuroscience Lab working with Jon Matthis. 
      As a post-doc, I built a new experimental paradigm using a Unity & Qualisys based <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSgmiTEVl78">augmented reality ground plane</a>
      to examine the relationship between eye movements and foot placement across complex terrain. You can find this project <a href="https://github.com/HuMoN-Research-Lab/AR_GroundPlane">on GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p> 
      In addition to my post-doctoral duties, I am leading the usability and product sides of The Free Motion Capture Project (FreeMoCap | <a href="https://freemocap.org"/>freemocap.org</a>).
      FreeMoCap takes modern advancements in computer vision and packages them to enable free 3D motion capture software for everyone!

    <h4> Looking For Work! </h4>
    <p> 
      While I have greatly enjoyed my post-doctoral experience, the position is inherently temporary! I'm looking to start a full time position in 2023.
    </p>
    <p> 
      The breadth and depth of my expertise has left me interested in a wide variety of career paths, spanning UX Research, Product Management, Project Management, and Software Engineering. 
      More than anything, I'm looking to join a great team of folks who I can learn from as well as pass along the valuable lessons I've learned from my "academic + startup" career thus far.

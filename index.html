    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>
      I am a Computational Perceptual-Motor Scientist whose expertise is in the visual control of locomotion. 
      I got my PhD in Cogntive Science from Brown University in the Winter of 2021. My doctoral thesis focused on understanding how complex coordinative behavior emerges in human crowds. 
      Since Fall of 2020, I have been a post-doctoral researcher in the Human Movement Neuroscience Lab working with Jon Matthis. 
      As a post-doc, I built a new experimental paradigm using an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSgmiTEVl78">augmented reality ground plane</a> of my own design to examine the relationship between eye movements and foot placement across complex terrain.
    </p>
    <p> 
      In addition to my post-doctoral duties, I am supporting the usability and operations side of The Free Motion Capture Project (FreeMoCap | <a href="https://freemocap.org"/>freemocap.org</a>), 
      making the recording and creation of human motion data easily accessible to animators and scientists.

    <h3> Looking For Work! </h3>
    <p> 
      While I have greatly enjoyed my post-doctoral experience, the position is inherently temporary! I'm looking to start a full time position in 2023.
    </p>
    <p> 
      The breadth and depth of expertise has left me interested in a wide variety of career paths, spanning Quantitative UX Research to Software Engineering. 
      More than anything, I'm looking to join a great team of folks who I can learn from as well as pass along the valuable lessons I've learned from my "academic + startup" career thus far.

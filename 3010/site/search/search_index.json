We might want to construct pipelines specifically designed for a particular data type; later on in our class we'll create functions. Some functions can be are type-specific, meaning they will only work if we supply that function with the correct data type. This is a good thing, because it means we can be sure that our functions are doing what we expect them to do.</li> <li>Different data types have different properties. For example, you can't add a string to an integer in the same way you can add two integers. This can be useful for controlling the flow of your program and ensuring that you're not doing something you didn't intend to do.</li> <li>Different properties allow you to control the flow of your program in different and nuanced ways. For example, you can use booleans to control whether or not a particular block of code is executed.

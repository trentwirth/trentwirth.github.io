# Welcome to the Side Quests!

A "Side Quests" emphasize and reinforce the skills you've learned so far - and introduce some new ones. This is optional additional work for those who want to dive a little deeper. 

Python has so much to offer that our class can't cover everything. Side Quests are a way to explore more advanced topics, learn new libraries, and practice your skills in a fun and engaging way.

Starting in Week 6, there will be a "Side Quest" every other week.

Side quests are not graded, but an opportunity for you to learn and explore independently. 

> Earlier in the semester, I created a "bonus step" where you could experiment with f-strings. I've now added that to the Side Quests section of the website!

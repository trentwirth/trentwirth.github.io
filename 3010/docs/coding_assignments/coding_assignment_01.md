# Coding Assignment 1

> Note: You should only begin this assignment when you have completed Step 4 of the Learning Path.

This assignment will test your understanding of the concepts covered up to Step 4 of the Learning Path. You will be asked to write Python code to solve a series of problems. 

Because what we've learned so far is limited, I will ask you to write a block of code that will end with a certain result/functionality. As a part of your assignment, you might need to explain how the resulting functionality is useful.

## Problem 1: Odd or Even?

Write a Python program that takes in an `input_integer` and then prints some information that would tell us if that number is odd or even.

The code block should look something like this:

```python
# We should be able to enter *any* integer here 
# and get the correct answer
input_integer =  

# ... your code here ...

print(output_information) 
# This can be a string, a boolean, or a number
# it should tell us if the input_integer is odd or even. 
# Explain why this output is useful in a comment.
```

## Problem 2: Temperature Conversion

Write a Python program that takes in a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit. 

Print the result.

The code block should look something like this:

```python
# We should be able to enter any temperature 
# (likely a float, not an integer) in Celsius here 
# and print the correct answer in Fahrenheit
celsius_temperature =  

# ... your code here ...

print(fahrenheit_temperature) 
# This should print the temperature in Fahrenheit.
```

## Problem 3: String + How Many Characters?

Write a Python program that takes an `input_string` and prints a statement that includes the string itself and its length. Use the [length function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_len.asp) (`len()`) function to determine the length of the string.

If our string was "Bearcat", the printed result should be something like: 
> *"The string 'Bearcat' has 7 characters."*

To generate a more complex print statement, you can use the `+` operator to concatenate strings, or you can explore the [f-string](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/formatted-string-literals-f-strings-python/) print method.
> f-strings are really cool, and is super useful!

The code block should look something like this:

```python
# We should be able to enter any string here 
# and get the correct answer
input_string =  

# ... your code here ...

# Print the string and its length in a descriptive statement
print(... your code here ...)
# This should print the input string and its length.
# Explain why this output is useful in a comment.
```

# Coding Assignment 5

In this coding assignment, you will download this zip file: [coding_assignment_05.zip](../files/coding_assignment_05.zip) (click to download).

The instructions to complete the coding assignment are embedded within the `.ipynb` file, the `coding_assignmnet_05` folder contains two files:

1. `coding_assignment_05.ipynb`: This is the Jupyter Notebook file that contains the instructions and code for the assignment.
2. `mediapipe_body_3d_xyz.npy`: This is a NumPy file that contains the 3D body pose data in XYZ format, which you will use in the assignment.

## Helpful Tips

- Unzip the downloaded file, and then don't move the files around. `coding_assignment_05.ipynb` expects the `mediapipe_body_3d_xyz.npy` file to be in the same directory!
- Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook step by step, ask questions if you're confused
- The notebook first starts by walking you through plotting some complex 3D data, and then you get points in the assignment where you fill in some blanks, make your own plot, and reflect on the process. 
- This assignment should be fun but also maybe a little weird! Plotting human movement data is second nature to me, but it takes time to develop intuition for what the data means. Ask questions! Follow your curiosity!

!!! Warning "Mime type error; `nbformat`"
     If your 3D plot isn't working, that is likely due to needing `nbformat` installed in your python environment. You can install it using pip:
     ```python
     !pip install nbformat>=4.2.0
     ```
     If this doesn't fix it, ask for help!

# When you finish

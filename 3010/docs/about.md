# About

This course is designed and created by Dr. Trenton Wirth, Psychology Professor at the University of Cincinnati.

It is made with the intention of introducing anyone to the basics of programming, with a focus on Python. The course is designed to be accessible to anyone, regardless of their prior experience with programming.

Trent is not a computer scientist, and doesn't claim to be an expert on programming. However, his journey of learning programming as a behavioral scientist himself equips him with the empathy and patience to develop a course targetting non-technical students who want to learn how to engage in scientific programming.

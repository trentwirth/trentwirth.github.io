# Core Path

There is a main learning path for this course, the starting place for all other "paths".

Each learning path is made up by a sequence of steps. Each step is a module that you need to complete in order to move on to the next step. The steps are designed to help you learn the material in a logical sequence.

Once you finish the Core Path, you can choose to go down one of the other two paths for the rest of the course. The other two paths are:

1. **Data Path**: This is the "default" path for the course, and is the path that most students will take. It is designed to introduce you to the basics of scientific programming including Python, data analysis, and data visualization.
2. **Game Dev Path**: This path is designed for students who are interested in game development, or human experiments that involve game development tools. It will introduce you to the basics of game development using JavaScript and the Phaser game engine.

# Intro to the "Game Dev Path"

Welcome to the Game Development (GD) Learning Path! I'm excited that you've chosen to go this route! There are so many different tools we could use to explore game development. I'm making a very specific choice for us to use [`Phaser`](https://phaser.io/), a JavaScript game framework. 

`Phaser` is a powerful and flexible tool that allows you to create 2D games for the web. It has a large community and many resources available, making it a great choice for beginners. In the Game Dev Path, we are going to focus on the *logic* of programming a game. This logic will extend to any programming language or game engine you might use in the future!

??? Tip "Game Engines?"
    A game engine is a software framework designed for the creation and development of video games. It provides a set of tools and features that simplify the game development process, allowing developers to focus on creating gameplay, graphics, and other elements of the game. Game engines often include components for rendering graphics, handling physics, managing audio, and providing scripting capabilities. While `Phaser` is a game engine, there are many others out there, including `Unity`, `Unreal Engine`, and `Godot`. The development process for these other three are different from `Phaser`, but the logic of programming a game is the same.

While you will become familiar with JavaScript through the course of using `Phaser`, the focus of this path is on the logic of programming a game. This means that you will learn how to think like a game developer, regardless of the programming language or game engine you use in the future. If you're interested in learning more about JavaScript, I highly recommend you look at Mozilla's [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), it is a comprehensive and well-structured resource for learning JavaScript from the ground up!

Okay, with all that said, [let's get started!](gd1.md)
